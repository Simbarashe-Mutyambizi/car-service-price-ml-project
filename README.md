# car-service-price-ml-project
## This project was made to predict the price for serivicing a car based on multiple factors that contributed to the price.
# the goal was to create an online web app that could quickly predict the price of a car to be serviced, which prompts quick customer service to the dealership company's customers.
# This will help maintain customers by avoiding overchanging and talking to longer to create an bill.
# Only factors that contribute to the price were used in this project.
